Structure:

Approach 1: Separates search and filter operations clearly.
Approach 2: Unifies search and filter operations under a single "filters" array.


Flexibility:

Approach 1: Allows multiple search columns but only one search term.
Approach 2: Can support multiple search operations with different terms for different fields.


Clarity:

Approach 1: The purpose of each field is immediately clear.
Approach 2: Requires parsing the "type" field to understand the operation.


Extensibility:

Approach 1: Adding new top-level operations (like sorting) is straightforward.
Approach 2: All operations need to fit into the "filters" array structure.


Backend Processing:

Approach 1: Easier to separate logic for search and filter operations.
Approach 2: Requires iterating through the filters array to separate operations.


Frontend Generation:

Approach 1: Might require separate UI components for search and filter.
Approach 2: Could use a more uniform UI approach for both search and filter.


Compatibility with existing systems:

Approach 1: More common in traditional API designs.
Approach 2: Resembles faceted search systems used in some search engines.



Recommendation:
I would recommend using a modified version of Approach 2. Here's why:

Unified Structure: It provides a unified way to handle both search and filter operations, which can simplify your API and make it more consistent.
Flexibility: It allows for multiple search operations on different fields, which your first approach doesn't support.
Extensibility: You can easily add new types of operations (like range filters) without changing the overall structure.
Frontend Friendly: This structure can lead to a more dynamic and uniform UI, where adding new filter or search options is straightforward.


{
  "operations": [
    {
      "type": "search",
      "field": "MAIN_TITLE",
      "value": "got"
    },
    {
      "type": "filter",
      "field": "cnty_cd",
      "values": ["US", "IN"]
    }
  ],
  "sortBy": {
    "field": "release_year",
    "order": "DESC"
  },
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0
  }
}
This structure:

Uses "operations" instead of "filters" to better represent that it includes both search and filter operations.
Keeps sorting and pagination separate, as they're fundamentally different from search/filter operations.
Uses "field" instead of "key" for consistency and clarity.
Allows for easy addition of new operation types in the future.

This approach provides a good balance between flexibility, clarity, and ease of use for both frontend and backend development. It also allows for easy extension as your application's needs grow.
