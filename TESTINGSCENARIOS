 it's important to cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure your code is robust and behaves correctly in various situations. Here are different scenarios and types of tests you should consider:

Happy Path Tests:

Test the expected behavior when all inputs are valid and the operation succeeds.
Example: Creating a movie with valid data.


Edge Cases:

Test boundary conditions and extreme values.
Example: Creating a movie with the maximum allowed length for the title.


Error Handling:

Test how your code handles invalid inputs or error conditions.
Example: Trying to get a movie with an ID that doesn't exist.


Null and Empty Inputs:

Test how your code handles null or empty values.
Example: Trying to create a movie with a null title.


Input Validation:

Test that your code properly validates inputs.
Example: Trying to set a negative value for movie duration.


State Changes:

Test that your code correctly changes (or doesn't change) state when operations are performed.
Example: Verifying that the movie count increases after adding a new movie.


Performance Tests:

Test that your code performs within acceptable time limits.
Example: Verifying that retrieving a large number of movies is done efficiently.


Concurrency Tests:

Test how your code behaves when multiple operations are performed simultaneously.
Example: Multiple threads trying to update the same movie simultaneously.


Dependency Behavior:

Test how your code behaves with different responses from its dependencies.
Example: Testing error handling when the database connection fails.


Different Input Types:

Test how your code handles different types of valid input.
Example: Creating movies with different genres, ratings, or release years.


Boundary Value Analysis:

Test values at the boundaries of equivalence partitions.
Example: Testing with movie durations of 0, 1, 59, 60, 61 minutes if 60 minutes is a special threshold.


Exception Handling:

Test that appropriate exceptions are thrown and handled correctly.
Example: Verifying that a MovieNotFoundException is thrown when trying to retrieve a non-existent movie.


Data Transformation:

Test that data is correctly transformed between different layers or formats.
Example: Verifying that a Movie object is correctly converted to a DTO and back.


Sorting and Filtering:

Test that sorting and filtering operations work correctly.
Example: Verifying that movies are correctly sorted by release date or filtered by genre.


Pagination:

Test that pagination works correctly for different page sizes and page numbers.
Example: Verifying that the correct subset of movies is returned for different page requests.


Authorization and Authentication:

Test that endpoints correctly enforce access controls.
Example: Verifying that only authorized users can create or delete movies.


Idempotency:

Test that operations that should be idempotent (e.g., PUT requests) behave correctly when called multiple times.
Example: Verifying that updating a movie multiple times with the same data doesn't cause unintended side effects.


Cross-field Validation:

Test validation rules that depend on multiple fields.
Example: Verifying that a movie can't have a release date in the future unless it's marked as "upcoming".


Cleanup and Resource Management:

Test that resources are properly released or cleaned up after operations.
Example: Verifying that database connections are closed after each operation.


Negative Testing:

Deliberately try to break the system to ensure it fails gracefully.
Example: Sending malformed JSON in a POST request to create a movie.
